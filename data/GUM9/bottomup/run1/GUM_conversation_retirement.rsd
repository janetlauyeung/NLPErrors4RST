31	that he opened up on this disclosure bit .	0	_	_	_	30	Causal_r	_	_
32	Because it was Burns that 's been objecting to our having it .	1	_	_	_	30	Causal_r	_	_
33	Oh ?	0	_	_	_	34	Topic_r	_	_
34	And I knew this .	2	_	_	_	30	Organization_r	_	_

36	and she followed through ,	0	_	_	_	35	Joint_m	_	_
37	and told about her husband ,	0	_	_	_	36	Joint_m	_	_
38	you know ?	1	_	_	_	35	Organization_r	_	_

45	And I – I can not get over this .	0	_	_	_	44	Evaluation_r	_	_
46	That man .	0	_	_	_	45	Elaboration_r	_	_

54	I really do believe that .	2	_	_	_	52	Organization_r	_	_

56	In his thinking .	2	_	_	_	54	Organization_m	_	_

59	That topples over .	0	_	_	_	60	Adversative_r	_	_
60	Um , but he did n't say that .	4	_	_	_	63	Organization_r	_	_
