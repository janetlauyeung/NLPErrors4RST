8	and read a book or something .	0	_	_	_	7	joint_m	_	_
9	Yeah ,	1	_	_	_	7	organization_r	_	_
10	or turn a deaf ear .	2	_	_	_	7	joint_m	_	_
11	That was for sure .	3	_	_	_	7	evaluation_r	_	_
12	But uh ,	4	_	_	_	7	organization_r	_	_
13	once you understand it ,	1	_	_	_	15	context_r	_	_
14	you know ,	0	_	_	_	15	organization_r	_	_

17	I really ought a call , at least Reg Barr ,	2	_	_	_	3	evaluation_r	_	_
18	and ask	0	_	_	_	19	attribution_r	_	_
19	if uh , he 's still speaking to me .	0	_	_	_	17	joint_m	_	_
20	Well now , he was the one	1	_	_	_	17	explanation_r	_	_

29	why would n't he ?	3	_	_	_	20	explanation_r	_	_
30	But a- anyway , um , I was so glad	0	_	_	_	31	attribution_r	_	_
31	that he opened up on this disclosure bit .	4	_	_	_	20	evaluation_r	_	_
32	Because it was Burns that 's been objecting to our having it .	1	_	_	_	31	explanation_r	_	_
33	Oh ?	0	_	_	_	32	organization_r	_	_
34	And I knew this .	1	_	_	_	32	evaluation_r	_	_
35	So when he opened up on that ,	2	_	_	_	32	elaboration_r	_	_
36	and she followed through ,	0	_	_	_	35	joint_m	_	_
37	and told about her husband ,	0	_	_	_	36	joint_m	_	_
38	you know ?	1	_	_	_	35	organization_r	_	_
39	Not necessarily that she would approve of it ,	1	_	_	_	40	adversative_r_r	_	_
40	but at least she was n't disapproving .	2	_	_	_	35	evaluation_r	_	_
41	Yeah .	0	_	_	_	42	organization_r	_	_
42	Of it .	0	_	_	_	40	organization_r	_	_
43	Yeah .	3	_	_	_	32	organization_r	_	_
44	And uh , course Duvall might –	2	_	_	_	45	organization_r	_	_
45	And I – I can not get over this .	2	_	_	_	17	evaluation_r	_	_
46	That man .	0	_	_	_	45	evaluation_r	_	_

48	And you know ,	1	_	_	_	49	organization_r	_	_
49	he must have been thinking ,	1	_	_	_	45	explanation_r	_	_
50	when he said	0	_	_	_	51	attribution_r	_	_
51	he was n't a political appointee ,	0	_	_	_	52	context_r	_	_
52	he must have been associating his relationship with Steitler .	0	_	_	_	49	same-unit_m	_	_
53	Oh .	1	_	_	_	56	organization_r	_	_
54	I really do believe that .	0	_	_	_	56	organization_r	_	_
55	Mhm .	0	_	_	_	54	organization_r	_	_
56	In his thinking .	2	_	_	_	49	evaluation_r	_	_
57	I do n't know	0	_	_	_	58	attribution_r	_	_
58	how else he could have done it .	3	_	_	_	49	evaluation_r	_	_
59	That topples over .	1	_	_	_	58	evaluation_r	_	_
60	Um , but he did n't say that .	2	_	_	_	65	organization_r	_	_
61	Oh ?	0	_	_	_	60	organization_r	_	_
62	He said ,	1	_	_	_	65	attribution_r	_	_

74	that was n't the point .	2	_	_	_	71	evaluation_r	_	_
75	The point was ,	1	_	_	_	76	organization_r	_	_
76	I could have mentioned what was in the paper about him ,	3	_	_	_	71	elaboration_r	_	_
77	that he was related	0	_	_	_	76	joint_m	_	_
