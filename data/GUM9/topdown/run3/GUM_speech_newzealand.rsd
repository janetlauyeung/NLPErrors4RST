10	The good news in this instance is that the individual had limited contact with people upon their return to the country ,	1	_	_	_	9	joint_m	_	_
11	and their family took all the appropriate measures	0	_	_	_	10	joint_m	_	_
12	when presenting at the emergency department .	0	_	_	_	11	context_r	_	_
13	As you would expect ,	1	_	_	_	14	explanation_r	_	_
14	our public health service is working hard	2	_	_	_	2	joint_m	_	_
15	to contain this first case	0	_	_	_	14	purpose_r	_	_
16	and limit the risk of any spread of the disease .	0	_	_	_	15	joint_m	_	_
17	Contact tracing began immediately	2	_	_	_	14	joint_m	_	_
18	and has gone to plan .	0	_	_	_	17	joint_m	_	_
19	All 15 people	1	_	_	_	17	elaboration_r	_	_
20	who were seated nearby the individual on their flight into New Zealand	0	_	_	_	19	elaboration_r	_	_
21	have been traced	1	_	_	_	19	same-unit_m	_	_
22	and are being told to self - isolate .	2	_	_	_	19	joint_m	_	_
23	Public health staff will remain in touch with individuals	3	_	_	_	19	joint_m	_	_
24	to monitor the situation	0	_	_	_	23	purpose_r	_	_
25	and give ongoing advice .	0	_	_	_	24	joint_m	_	_
26	All but 10 of the remaining passengers on the flight ,	1	_	_	_	23	joint_m	_	_
27	who are not considered to be close contacts ,	0	_	_	_	26	elaboration_r	_	_
28	have also been contacted	1	_	_	_	26	same-unit_m	_	_
29	to provide reassurance	2	_	_	_	26	purpose_r	_	_
30	and answer any questions	0	_	_	_	29	joint_m	_	_
31	they might have ;	0	_	_	_	30	elaboration_r	_	_
32	those 10	3	_	_	_	26	adversative_m	_	_
33	that have n't been contacted	0	_	_	_	32	elaboration_r	_	_
34	did not provide accurate contact information .	1	_	_	_	32	same-unit_m	_	_
35	I 'm advised	1	_	_	_	36	attribution_r	_	_
36	that	2	_	_	_	17	evaluation_r	_	_
37	as a result of our decisive response ,	0	_	_	_	38	causal_r	_	_
38	the chance of an outbreak from our first case is low .	0	_	_	_	36	same-unit_m	_	_
39	Internationally , the situation with COVID - 19 continues to develop at pace .	3	_	_	_	41	adversative_r_r	_	_
40	However , the Director - General of the World Health Organization said , this morning ,	1	_	_	_	41	attribution_r	_	_
41	containment â€¦ is feasible	3	_	_	_	14	joint_m	_	_
42	and must remain the top priority for all countries .	0	_	_	_	41	joint_m	_	_
43	This is exactly the approach	2	_	_	_	41	elaboration_r	_	_
44	that New Zealand is taking ,	0	_	_	_	43	elaboration_r	_	_
45	using three main tools :	1	_	_	_	46	organization_r	_	_
46	border controls ; self - isolation ; and good public health practices ,	1	_	_	_	43	mode_r	_	_
47	including highlighting the importance of basic hygiene .	0	_	_	_	46	elaboration_r	_	_
48	At every step , the Government has taken decisions in the interests of health and safety of the wider public ,	4	_	_	_	41	joint_m	_	_
49	and so far we have been among the best	0	_	_	_	48	joint_m	_	_
50	at keeping COVID - 19 at bay .	0	_	_	_	49	elaboration_r	_	_
51	Just yesterday , Cabinet decided to extend for another week the travel restrictions	1	_	_	_	48	explanation_r	_	_
52	that have been in place for China since 3 February and for Iran since last Friday .	0	_	_	_	51	elaboration_r	_	_
53	These restrictions have played a key role	1	_	_	_	51	elaboration_r	_	_
54	in keeping COVID - 19 out of New Zealand for so long	0	_	_	_	53	elaboration_r	_	_
55	and have given us time	1	_	_	_	53	joint_m	_	_
56	to better understand the disease	0	_	_	_	55	purpose_r	_	_
57	and ramp up our preparations .	0	_	_	_	56	joint_m	_	_
58	Of course , members will be aware	0	_	_	_	59	attribution_r	_	_
59	that there are outbreaks in other regions as well .	3	_	_	_	61	context_r	_	_
60	So , as a further precaution , we have decided	1	_	_	_	61	attribution_r	_	_
61	that anyone arriving in New Zealand	2	_	_	_	48	joint_m	_	_
62	who has been in northern Italy or South Korea	0	_	_	_	61	same-unit_m	_	_
63	who has been there in the last 14 days	0	_	_	_	62	elaboration_r	_	_
64	will be registered for self - isolation .	1	_	_	_	62	same-unit_m	_	_
65	This is based on an expert assessment of risk .	2	_	_	_	61	elaboration_r	_	_
66	It recognises	1	_	_	_	67	attribution_r	_	_
67	that	0	_	_	_	65	elaboration_r	_	_
68	while there are outbreaks in both countries ,	1	_	_	_	69	adversative_r_r	_	_
69	they also have well - developed health systems	0	_	_	_	67	same-unit_m	_	_
70	and the outbreaks are largely located in specific regions .	0	_	_	_	69	joint_m	_	_
71	We know	0	_	_	_	72	attribution_r	_	_
72	self - isolation works .	4	_	_	_	61	evaluation_r	_	_
73	It is a longstanding and successful approach	1	_	_	_	72	explanation_r	_	_
74	to managing infectious diseases	0	_	_	_	73	purpose_r	_	_
75	and has proven its worth again in recent weeks .	1	_	_	_	73	joint_m	_	_
76	We have also stepped up the health presence at our airports .	3	_	_	_	48	joint_m	_	_
77	All airlines	0	_	_	_	76	elaboration_r	_	_
78	flying into New Zealand	0	_	_	_	77	elaboration_r	_	_
79	have been requested to read a health message	1	_	_	_	77	same-unit_m	_	_
80	upon landing ,	0	_	_	_	79	context_r	_	_
81	and all arrivals into New Zealand will receive health information cards alongside the standard customs declaration form .	2	_	_	_	77	joint_m	_	_
82	As a result of decisions	3	_	_	_	77	joint_m	_	_
83	taken on Friday ,	0	_	_	_	82	elaboration_r	_	_
84	health staff are meeting all direct international flights	1	_	_	_	82	same-unit_m	_	_
85	landing in New Zealand airports from Hong Kong , Japan , South Korea , Singapore , and Thailand .	0	_	_	_	84	elaboration_r	_	_
86	Our border response is further ramping up	2	_	_	_	82	joint_m	_	_
87	to have health staff available for all international flights into New Zealand .	0	_	_	_	86	purpose_r	_	_
88	All these decisions and actions are designed	3	_	_	_	82	elaboration_r	_	_
89	to limit the spread of any sporadic COVID - 19 cases	0	_	_	_	88	purpose_r	_	_
90	that might arrive in New Zealand .	0	_	_	_	89	elaboration_r	_	_
91	At the same time , our health system continues its preparations in line with our comprehensive pandemic plan .	1	_	_	_	76	joint_m	_	_
92	I want to thank our DHBs , public health staff , and primary care and health officials for the work	2	_	_	_	76	joint_m	_	_
